# Crypto-Coin

This is a repo to work with and use NFTs smart contracts in a Python env. Crypto-Coin allows you to design and create superhero tokens that are deployed and listed on Opensea. Heroes have 3 types: stealth, alien, and mutant.

This is a repo to work with and use NFTs smart contracts in a python environment, using the Chainlink-mix as a starting point.

If you'd like to see another repo using random NFTs that are deployed to mainnet, check out the [D&D package](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/dungeons-and-dragons-nft).

## Prerequisites

Please install or have installed the following:

- [nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

```bash
pip install eth-brownie
```

Or, if that doesn't work, via pipx

```bash
pip install --user pipx
pipx ensurepath
# restart your terminal
pipx install eth-brownie
```

brownie bake crypto-coin
cd crypto-coin

1. [Install ganache-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli)

```bash
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

If you want to be able to deploy to testnets, do the following.

4. Set your environment variables

Set your `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`, and `PRIVATE_KEY` [environment variables](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html).

You can get a `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` by getting a free trial of [Infura](https://infura.io/). At the moment, it does need to be infura with brownie. You can find your `PRIVATE_KEY` from your ethereum wallet like [metamask](https://metamask.io/).

You'll also need testnet rinkeby ETH and LINK. You can get LINK and ETH into your wallet by using the [rinkeby faucets located here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/link-token-contracts#rinkeby). If you're new to this, [watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7FX_1PePX0)

You can add your environment variables to the `.env` file:

```
export WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>
```

## OpenSea Deployment
